ENG:	Check it out, this is the world's fastest turbo-snowboard course! The local champions are the Sasquatch Six, a gang of yeti's on souped up snow-discs. I bet that you could outrace the lot of 'em! If you win, we get a huge pile of treasure! If you lose, I have to slick down the whole course with my tongue.

ENG:	YEEESSSSSSS! You schooled 'em like a bunch of frost-bitten, flat-footed, molasses-eating, lead-pants-wearing, cross-eyed glacier-trolls riding slabs of plywood with sandpaper on the bottom!!! ... And we won some shiny stuff, too.
