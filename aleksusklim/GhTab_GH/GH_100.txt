+ This rhynoc is too big to charge. You'll have to flame him using the { button.

$ 
+ Hi Spyro! Each time a fairy zaps you, like this...
$ 
+ That means your progress is saved. If you get into trouble you'll return to the last place you got zapped.

> Councillor George
$ 
+ Oh my! Oh my! Can you help us? Hordes of ferocious rhynocs have overrun our town and kidnapped the mayor.
$ 
+ Are you a dragon? I never believed you really existed.
$ 
+ Would you like a chicken sandwich? They're very good.
$ 
+ Those pesky rhynocs are back again, but I'm sure you'll soon sort them out.
$ 

> Citizen Paulus
$ 
+ Let me catch my breath and I'll kick that other guy's butt.
$ 
+ We showed those two bullies. If they hadn't outnumbered me two to one, I'd have finished them off ages ago.
$ 
+ Have you seen any giant chickens around here?
$ 

> Mayor Leo
$ 
+ Thank you for rescuing my town. As mayor I award you with one of our famous giant chicken eggs.
$ 
+ I'm sorry, that was the ugliest chicken I've ever seen.
$ 

> Citizen Horace
$ 
+ Whoo I'm dizzy.
$ 
+ Thanks for the help, but I think I would have worn him down in a minute.
$ 
+ Have you seen any of our giant chickens? The rhynocs have been trying to eat them all.
$ 
+ Look, a chicken turned up. I hope it's not the only one left.

$ 
+ Spyro, thanks for dropping by, but I'm currently busy in my home world. Come visit me there.\          -Sheila
$ 
+ Come on in!\     -Sheila

$ 
+ What! Marco sent you here? I've got a restraining order against him.
$ 
+ If you see Marco please tell him I've moved out.
$ 

> Sheila
$ 
+ Hey Spyro, there are rhynocs everywhere. Maybe I can find some peace and quiet at the top of the tower...
$ 

> Marco
$ 
+ Alas, I have lost my love, guarded by evil rhynocs at the top of yonder tower. Can you rescue her for me?

+ Hi Spyro. I found this gladiator training arena and it makes a pretty cool skate park! Care for a test of your boarding skills? &Start boarding challenge now? &Yes. &No.
$ 
+ Are you ready for a challenge now? &Start boarding challenge now? &Yes. &No.
$ 
+ I bet you can't catch all fifteen of the lizards running around here... Just come back if you want some boarding tips from the master. &[Catch the lizards.
$ 
+ Yeah, maybe you'd better practice a bit first... Just come back here when you're up for a challenge.
$ 
+ Having trouble? If you use the < button to jump off the ramps you'll get extra height and distance.
$ 
+ Caught all the lizards yet? If you're having trouble catching them, don't be afraid to use your flame breath while on the skateboard.
$ 
+ Hey that was great! And while you were boarding, I found this in a lizard burrow.
$ 
+ Now that you've mastered the basics, let's see you do some stunts! Try using the < or } button to jump off ramps and turn in the air...
$ 
+ This is the most fun I've had since we chased King Flippy on the manta ray.
$ 
+ Alright, if you can catch all the lizards without wiping out and before time runs out, I  might be able to scrounge up another egg. It's not gonna be easy, though... &Start difficult boarding challenge now? &Yes. &No.
$ 
+ If you want to try to catch those lizards, I'll start the clock now. &Start difficult boarding challenge now? &Yes. &No.
$ 
+ Go get 'em, Spyro!
$ 
+ Well whenever you're ready, come and talk to me.
$ 
+ Awww, too bad... maybe you'll do better this time. &Try difficult boarding challenge again? &Yes. &No.
$ 
+ Whoa, that was sweet! And look, there was another egg in the lizard burrow.
$ 
+ You can go for the course record now, if you want. Whenever you hop on a skateboard, a timer will start. Score as many points as you can until the timer expires or you wipe out. Good luck!
