+ Hi Spyro! Each time a fairy zaps you, like this...
+ That means your progress is saved. If you get into trouble you'll return to the last place you got zapped.

> Councillor George
+ Oh my! Oh my! Can you help us? Hordes of ferocious rhynocs have overrun our town and kidnapped the mayor.
+ Are you a dragon? I never believed you really existed.
+ Would you like a chicken sandwich? They're very good.
+ Those pesky rhynocs are back again, but I'm sure you'll soon sort them out.

> Citizen Paulus
+ Let me catch my breath and I'll kick that other guy's butt.
+ We showed those two bullies. If they hadn't outnumbered me two to one, I'd have finished them off ages ago.
+ Have you seen any giant chickens around here?

> Mayor Leo
+ Thank you for rescuing my town. As mayor I award you with one of our famous giant chicken eggs.
+ I'm sorry, that was the ugliest chicken I've ever seen.

> Citizen Horace
+ Whoo I'm dizzy.
+ Thanks for the help, but I think I would have worn him down in a minute.
+ Have you seen any of our giant chickens? The rhynocs have been trying to eat them all.
+ Look, a chicken turned up. I hope it's not the only one left.
