+ Here is my riddle:\ I am a vessel without hinges, lock or lid,\ yet, within my walls, a golden treasure is hid.\ What am I?
+ Don't try to answer the riddle now. You'll need to save your breath to survive the trials of the catacombs.

+ I see you've managed to survive the trials of the catacombs. Now let's find out if your wits are as quick as your feet. Do you remember the riddle?
+ I am a vessel without hinges, lock or lid,\ yet, within my walls, a golden treasure is hid.\ What am I? &A bone &An egg &A treasure chest &A bandicoot
+ Hmmmm... have you heard that one before? I never thought you'd get it. Very well, a bargain is a bargain. You may have the dragon egg that I was guarding from the Sorceress.
+ Sorry, dragon, that's completely wrong. You can try again, but you'll never get it by merely guessing.
+ I've waited seven thousand years for someone to solve that riddle... Now I can finally head off to Seashell Shore to bury some bones!
