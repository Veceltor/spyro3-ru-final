+ \           That gator was mean.\          I thought I was a goner.\           Thanks for saving me.
+           Our tea lamps are dark.\         Perhaps your hot dragon breath\           could set them aglow.
+           No happier sight\         Have I seen, than a tea lamp\           lit by Dragonflame.
+ \           Beware the water.\         Snapping jaws of piranha\           claim many victims.

+ \           When all lamps are lit\          there is a secret in here\            that I will show you.
+ \           The tea lamps are lit!\         Now I'll tell you the secret\           of what's in this house!
+ \           A creepy wizard\    lives inside, but hates the light.\           He has awoken.
+ \           He swore to destroy\        whoever lights the tea lamps.\           Better you than me. &[Use Wizard's bombs against him. &[Avoid Gators.

+ \           This door is jammed shut.\            Only the power of gems\             Can hope to move it. &Pay ^^^ gems to open the door? &Sure, just shut up. &No, your haiku poetry stinks.
+ \           You've made a wise choice...\        It will mean more eggs for you...\              And more gems for me. \           Best of all, Spyro...\        I can stop speaking Haiku.\           What a sweet relief!
+ \           Dad gummit, dragon.\      Just cough up those stinking gems.\           And I can go home.
+ \           I can't let you through.\       You're too poor to pass this door.\           Come back with more cash. &[^^^ gems needed to open door
+ \           Stop talking to me.\         I hate speaking in Haiku.\           Just go find some gems...
