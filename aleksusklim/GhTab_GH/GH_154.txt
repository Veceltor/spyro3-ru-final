+ Spyro, did you know I happen to be a very talented amateur magician? My specialty is the, err... 'Amazing Extending Bridge' trick. I'd love to show you, but I need a small donation first... for my expenses, you understand... &Pay ^^^^ gems to cross the bridge? &Not again... Ok, fine... &I'm happy over here.
+ Very good. Errr... let's see... 'Hocus Pocus, Zigglety Zen, Make This Bridge Get Long Again!'
+ You shouldn't anger a magician, Spyro. I just might decide to turn you into a blue hedgehog or something.
+ Hmph... These gnomes think they're so talented... I happen to know a pretty good magic trick, myself! It's called the... incredible... magical... err, extending bridge trick. However, you'll need a few more gems to make a donation... After all, I am just a poor, starving amateur magician... &[Crossing bridge costs ^^^^ gems.
+ I'm afraid the show's over, Spyro. Why don't you go play with the gnomes? I think they look lonely.

+ Shhh! Spyro, don't tell anyone but we've stolen some magic from the Sorceress. We're hiding here whilst we practice using it. Unfortunately we've had a bit of an accident and turned everything into crystal, and it seems to have aggravated the indiginous creatures.
+ I really think I'm beginning to get the hang of this magic malarkey.
+ Acrabadabar...no...acrabadadoo...no, no, that isn't right. Just hold on a minute I'll get it.

> The Fantastic Frederico
+ All this magic is just misdirection you know. Which is why I'm going to start that whirlwind over there... ABRACADABRA!
+ Ok, I'll show you again. If you watch carefully maybe you'll be able to see how it's done... ABRACADABRA!
+ I'm working on a new trick now, but I've left the whirlwind going in case you need to use it.

> The Astounding Arturo
+ I've been working on a great new magic trick, but this bear keeps spoiling it.
+ Well, I suppose I could show you my new trick. As long as you promise not to tell the Great Zamboni, he steals all my best work... ALAKAZAM!
+ Did you tell the Great Zamboni? That charlatan has been stealing my tricks again.

+ Here, you can have this. I was going to use it in a trick, but my magic just keeps bouncing off.

> The Great Zamboni
+ Would you like to see a magic trick? Watch carefully, as you can see there is nothing up my left sleeve, nothing up my right sleeve, but now with a wave of my hands and the magic word... ALAKAZAM!
+ You want to see the trick again? Well, alright but I want you to know this isn't as easy as it looks... ALAKAZAM!
+ Hey, I finally seem to have got the hang of this, those crystals have stayed up for ages.
