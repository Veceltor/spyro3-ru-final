+ Be sure to keep your friend Sparx the Dragonfly healthy Spyro. If his health is low, torch a little creature like this slug below me to release a butterfly.

+ Rhynocs are running rampant around here, but I can't get anyone out of the Tiki Lodge long enough to do anything about it.
+ Well, it looks like it's just you and me. I'll keep a look out while you sort out the rhynocs.

+ Spyro, you're just in time! I saw two egg thieves run through this door! Well... actually, they paid me to guard their hideout, but that's irrelevant. I'll happily let you through the gate to chase them down... for, ahem, a small finder's fee... &Pay ^^^ gems to enter the thieves' den? &Ok, ok... &Get lost, loser!
+ Thank you, Spyro, and best of luck catching those dastardly egg thieves.
+ Very well, Spyro, it's up to you... Maybe if we both just hold hands and think happy thoughts, the thieves will decide to return the eggs themselves.
+ Well, Spyro, it's good to see you! This gate I'm guarding happens to be the secret entrance to an egg thief hideout... Of course, I can't let you enter with a clean conscience... At least not without paying a small fee. &[Entering thief hideout costs ^^^ gems.
+ I guess those egg thieves are going to get what's coming to them... it's too bad... I always sort of liked those guys.
