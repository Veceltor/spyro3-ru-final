+ While I was gone, my friends borrowed the rhynocs' submarine... then they took it for a joy ride... and then they smashed it into a big pile of rocks. Oddly enough, the rhynocs failed to see the humor in the story and stuffed my friends in the jail behind you.
+ The rhynocs have boarded up a lot of our doors, but I bet you're strong enough to smash them down. &[Use charge to smash boards.
