+ Oh hewwo, it's good to see you again, Spywo. That naughty sorcewess has stolen the pwofessor's wocket plans and I'm on a secwet mission to find them. Handel was supposed to meet me here but I can't find him anywhere. Maybe you could help?
+ It looks like you'll have to use this cannon to get across here, simply climb aboard. As for me I just have to fwee my mind...
+ It looks like the sorcewess has already used the plans to build her own wocket. We have to destwoy it. Just follow me.
+ Hey, look what was in the wocket. They must have been twying to put it into orbit.
+ If you see Handel tell him I've gone back to Evening Lake to finish work on the pwofessor's wocket.
