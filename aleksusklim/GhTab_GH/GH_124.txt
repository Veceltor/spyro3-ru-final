+ Please be careful those rockets are dangerous!
+ Please would you be so kind as to step aside.
+ Oh no, I think that water buffalo is going to trample me.
+ Just let me catch my breath.
+ If only there were three of us I'm sure we could reach that switch to open the drawbridge.

> Chi Chi
+ Help, help!
+ Please would you be so kind as to step aside.
+ If you could rescue Li we'd be able to push this boulder out of the way.
+ Pushing that boulder was hard work, but as soon as I've caught my breath I'll return to collecting bamboo.
+ Wahey! Ahem, sorry the excitement got the better of me.

> Tsai
+ Help!!
+ Please would you be so kind as to step aside.
+ 
+ I'll be with you momentarily, I just need to rest for a second.
+ If only there were three of us I'm sure we could reach that switch to open the drawbridge.

+ To All Explorers: There is no yeti here, and there never was! He was just a myth. As far as you know.      -The Sorceress
+ Dreadfully sorry to inconvenience you, Spyro, but I have been detained for the moment. Please come visit my outpost, if it suits you.        -Bentley
+ Welcome, most esteemed dragon.        -Bentley

+ Spyro! Rhynocs have been harassing us all day. The workers haven't been able to harvest the bamboo needed for the whirligig to take you to Evening Lake. We've tried asking them to leave, but there's no reasoning with them.
+ If you could clear the way for Chi Chi and Li they'd most likely be able to push that boulder out of your way.
+ Thank you ever so much for opening the emergency bridge, Spyro.
+ Doobedoobedoo.
