$ 
+ Just hop up onto the cannon and take out that bird!
$ 
+ Nice shootin!
$ 
+ The cannon's all yours if you want it.

> Bo Peep
$ 
+ My name is Little Bo Peep, and I have lost my cowleks. With these battles going on all of the time, they keep running away. Can you help me get them back into my pen? &[Get 5 cowleks into the pen.
$ 
+ Spyro, can you help me get the cowleks back into their pen? &[Get 5 cowleks into the pen.
$ 
+ Thanks Spyro. Here's a little something, you know, for the effort.
$ 
+ I'm still waiting for those 7 cowleks. &[Get 2 more cowleks into the pen
$ 
+ Well I am impressed. You got all 7 cowleks for me. Here's a fair reward.
$

+ What light from yonder window breaks? That window up there dummy. The Professor said he was working on a way to help me get back with Juliet, but I haven't seen him in a long time. &[Find the professor.
$ 
+ You've reunited me with Juliet! Now we can take our honeymoon in Colossus Springs and see the idols!
$ 

> Juliet
$ 
+ Romeo, Romeo, Wherefore art thou, Romeo. Oh, there's Romeo! You can have this, I don't need it anymore.
$ 
+ How I've missed my Romeo. If he wasn't so short, we'd get married.

> Professor
$ 
+ Well done, my boy. Here are 2 more seeds to get you the rest of the way.
$ 
+ Misplaced your seeds, have you? I can make all the plants shrink again if you'd like to start over. &Would you like to start over?&Yes, please&Never mind
$ 
+ Off you go then.
$ 
+ Here you go. Be more careful with these.
$ 
+ Well done, my boy. Here are 2 more seeds to get you the rest of the way. Oh, and take this with you, if you don't mind. It's been cluttering up my pockets.
$ 

> Professor
$ 
+ Spyro, my boy. I've got a magic bean, er, I mean seed for you in here somewhere. Ah, here it is. Why don't you plant it in the ground and see what grows?
$ 
+ Misplaced your seeds, have you? I can make all the plants shrink again if you'd like to start over. &Would you like to start over?&Yes, please&Never mind
$ 
+ Off you go then.
$ 
+ Here you go. Be more careful with this one.
$ 
+ Do you know the square root of 22,341?
$ 
+ Aiming the seed by holding down the } button will make this easier... Oh, and if you ever need your seed back, just flame the plant, and it will turn back into a seed again. &[Plant seeds to climb to Juliet.

> Corporal Glug
$ 
+ Wow. What an explosion! It sure is a good thing I had my helmet on. Oh yeah, the Colonel wanted me to give this talisman to you if you got through the Breezebuilder defenses. Good job, soldier!
